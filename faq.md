###Applicant Screening and Candidate Selection

**What is the selection process?**  
A panel of disability experts (Program Executive Committee) and ICI program staff will review all valid applications and select those individuals whose applications meet the program objectives. Successful applicants will be invited to participate in an interview at the Duskin Ainowa Foundation in Osaka. The Program Executive Committee and ICI program staff will make final decisions after interviewing all potential candidates.

**How do you evaluate applicants?**  
We are looking for applicants who can describe their personal and professional disability leadership goals, and are able to explain how this program will help them achieve these goals.

**I have a question about my application. Who can I contact?**  
If you have any questions about the application and selection process, contact Dr. Heike Boeltzig-Brown at [heike.boeltzig@umb.edu](mailto:heike.boeltzig@umb.edu)

###Your Training and Life in Boston

**What expenses are covered, and what will I have to pay for?**  

 The program will cover:

-	Travel to the interview and other pre-training meetings within Japan,
-	Round trip airfare from an international airport in Japan to Boston,
-	Accommodation (including utilities) in Boston for the duration of the training, and
-	Food, local transport etc. through a monthly stipend of US $ 1,700 (per trainee).

The trainee must pay for:

-	Fees for travel documents, such as passport and visa,
-	Travel between the trainee’s home and an international airport in Japan,
-	Hotel expenses (if needed) at departure and arrival,
-	Costs for purchasing overseas travel insurance (required), and
-	Other personal expenses during the training, such as recreational expenses.

**Where will I live?**  
Trainees live in communities in or around Boston. They have the option to live with other trainees in apartments (based on double occupancy). They can also decide to live with a host family. In either case, the program will arrange housing for each trainee.

**Will the program provide the accommodations that I need?**  
We encourage individuals with any types of disabilities to apply. Acceptance decisions will be made based upon merit and alignment with the program’s training objectives and not on accommodations requested.

We are committed to accommodating Duskin trainees with any types of disabilities. However, candidates must be able to carry out activities of daily life without assistance. The program does not cover the costs for a personal care assistant.

**Will the training be conducted in English?**  
Yes. We expect trainees to have a basic understanding of English language or American Sign Language (ASL). During the four-week program orientation, we provide English language or ASL refresher training.

**I am fluent in English / American Sign Language (ASL). Do I still need to participate in the English-language or ASL courses?**  
You may not need to participate in English language or ASL courses, but we make this decision case by case. We will look at the results of your written test and oral interview to determine whether you will be required to participate in English or ASL courses.

**Can I select which disability studies courses to take?**  
Yes. We will provide you with a list of course options related to your training interests and goals, and help you select those that best fit your needs and training schedule. You can audit or take for credit up to two disability studies courses.

**Will I receive college credit for the disability studies and English-language coursework?**  
You have the option to audit or take for credit disability studies and English-language courses. If you wish to transfer any credits to your Japanese university or college, it will be your responsibility to coordinate that.

**Am I responsible for finding an internship site?**  
No. The Duskin program will match trainees with internship sites and mentors. We will try to find a placement for each trainee that will support his or her individual training goals.

**Will I be able to sightsee while I am in Boston?**  
The training program is full-time, but there are also opportunities for local sightseeing and travelling. Trainees have weekends free, and the Duskin program coordinator can suggest trips in and around Boston, Massachusetts, and New England.  

**Can I go on vacation within the United States or elsewhere during the training?**  
Trainees should expect to stay in the United States for the entire duration of the training.  Please contact the Program Executive Committee to request an exception to this rule.

**Can I go home to visit my family during the training?**  
Trainees should expect to stay in the United States for the entire duration of the training.  Please contact the Program Executive Committee to request an exception to this rule.

###After Training

**What happens after the training?**  
You will receive a certificate of completion, and you will serve as a mentor to future trainees.  Mentors give presentations in Japan about what they learned during their Duskin training. They also make themselves available via phone and Skype to talk with other young Japanese people with disabilities. Duskin trainees continue to build their personal and professional leadership skills through work and advocacy in their communities.

The Duskin program does not offer job placement or career counseling services to its graduates. However, the network of connections that trainees build is often helpful in finding paid employment after completing our program.
