- Round trip airfare from an international airport in Japan to Boston,
- Accommodation (including utilities) in Boston for the duration of the training, and 
- Food, local transport etc. through a monthly stipend of US $ 1,700 (per trainee).

The trainee must cover:

- Travel between the trainee’s home and an international airport in Japan and hotel expenses (if needed) at departure and arrival, 
- Costs for purchasing overseas travel insurance (required), and
- Other personal expenses during the training, such as recreational expenses. 

**Where will I live?**
Trainees live in communities in or around Boston. They have the option to live with other trainees in apartments (based on double occupancy). They can also decide to live with a host family. In either case, the program will arrange housing for each trainee.

**Will the program provide the accommodations that I need?**
We encourage applications from individuals with any types of disabilities. Decisions about acceptance into the Duskin Disability Leadership Training Program will be based upon merit and match with the program’s training objectives and not on accommodations requested. 

We are committed to accommodating Duskin trainees with any types of disabilities. However, candidates must be able to carry out activities of daily life without assistance. The program does not cover the costs for a personal care assistant.

**I am fluent in English / American Sign Language (ASL). Do I still need to participate in the English-language or ASL courses?**
You may not need to participate in English language or ASL courses, but we make this decision case by case.  We will look at the results of your written test and oral interview to determine whether you will be required to participate in English or ASL courses.

**Can I go on vacation within the United States or elsewhere during the training?** 
Trainees should expect to stay in the United States for the entire duration of the training.  Please contact the Program Executive Committee to request an exception to this rule.

**Can I go home to visit my family during the training?**
Trainees should expect to stay in the United States for the entire duration of the training.  Please contact the Program Executive Committee to request an exception to this rule.

**What happens after the training?**
You will receive a certificate of completion, and you will serve as a mentor to future trainees.  Mentors give presentations in Japan about what they learned during their Duskin training They also make themselves available via phone and Skype to talk with other young Japanese people with disabilities. Duskin trainees continue to build their personal and professional leadership skills through work and advocacy in their communities. 

The Duskin program does not offer job placement or career counseling services to its graduates. However, the network of connections that trainees build is often helpful in finding paid employment after completing our program.
