<blockquote>The UMass Boston community is looking forward to learning first-hand from Japan’s next generation of disability leaders.</blockquote>
<p><em>—Provost Winston Langley, UMass Boston</em></p>

The Duskin Disability Leadership Program is an intensive five-month training program for <strong>Japanese people with disabilities</strong>, ages 18 to 35. The program, which takes place in Boston, trains these young people to develop <b>leadership and advocacy skills</b>, which they then bring back to Japan.

One part of the training program is an <b>internship</b> at a local agency or community organization <b>focused on disability</b>. This gives our trainees a chance to apply what they learn about disability studies and leadership. It’s also a chance for your organization to get a committed, talented intern!

Potential internship sites include disability services providers, self- advocacy organizations, vocational rehabilitation agencies, schools, businesses, public transportation agencies, disability law associations, and NGOs with a focus on accessibility and universal design.

<b>We’d love to expand our pool of internship sites!</b> Read on to learn more about how it works and to see if this might be a good fit for your organization.

###1) What would an intern do on the job?  
Trainees might do a range of tasks and activities, including:

- Assisting staff who work on disability projects in the community with outreach and recruitment of youth with disabilities
- Developing a program flyer about your organization in Japanese that is distributed to Japanese families with children living in Boston  
- Supporting staff with collecting project data, for example, observing children with disabilities in inclusive classroom settings and recording their behavior  
- Implementing surveys, for example, surveying public transportation users who have mobility issues and translating the survey results into Japanese  

###2) How do you match trainees and internship sites?  
Trainees are matched with the internship site based on individual interests, project topics, and training needs. Each internship meets the needs of both the trainee and the host site.

###3) How long are the internships?  
Internships usually start in early September and go until mid-December. We are flexible on dates and duration, and will work with you and the trainee to design an optimal schedule.  

###4) How many days a week would the intern be here?
We are looking for a minimum of one day (five to seven hours) per week of trainee engagement. Again, this could be longer depending upon the trainee’s availability and your organization’s needs.  

###5) What are the requirements for an internship site?
The main requirements are a commitment to disability inclusion, and the willingness to work closely with our program to design an optimal experience for everyone involved. We also ask that each internship site assign a staff person to mentor the intern.  

###6) Are financial supports available?
Yes. Depending on how many interns your organization accepts and how intense their internships are, we will partially reimburse you for staffing and other costs.  

###7) How will you coordinate the internship?
Duskin Program Coordinator Miwa Tanabe will help our trainees transition into their internships, and will work closely with you and your staff. Ms. Tanabe will periodically check in with our trainees and with you to make sure everything runs smoothly.

###8) Who runs your program?
The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston is partnering with the Duskin Ainowa Foundation to run this training program. Since the 1960s, the ICI has been a leader in disability inclusion and advocacy. The Duskin Ainowa Foundation has a 30-year history of supporting disability leadership training in Asia and beyond.  

##We look forward to hearing from you!
