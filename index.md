<p style="display:block">The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston is partnering with the Duskin Ainowa Foundation on a leadership training program in Boston, Massachusetts. This intensive five-month program trains Japanese people with disabilities to develop leadership skills, which they then bring back to Japan.</p>

<p>The Duskin Ainowa Foundation has been in existence for over 30 years, and launched this Boston-based program in 2014. Since its launch, the foundation has provided individual fellowships funding Japanese people with disabilities to go abroad to gain disability leadership and advocacy skills. Starting in 2014, in addition to those individual fellowships, the program also began using a new group or cohort model to further participants’ disability leadership and advocacy training.</p>
