The Duskin Disability Leadership Program at UMass Boston enables trainees to develop their capacity for personal and professional disability leadership. This program cultivates a cohort of leaders who will engage in advocacy, policy, and service provision within the Japanese disability community.

Our program provides opportunities for Japanese individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 to participate in a five-month intensive disability leadership and advocacy training in Boston, Massachusetts. The goal of the program is to build disability leadership capacity in Japan. The program is sponsored by the Duskin Ainowa Foundation and implemented by the ICI at UMass Boston.

Through this program, participants not only enhance their leadership and advocacy skills; they also gain new knowledge and skills related to disability and inclusion. Trainees also improve their English language or American Sign Language proficiency.

The program uses a group or cohort model to further participants’ leadership and advocacy training. However, trainees also pursue their own independent projects inspired by a question, issue, or problem related to disability. Participants work with the program’s executive committee and ICI program staff to design and implement these independent projects.

As part of their projects, trainees participate in an internship with a disability-focused government or community organization. Each internship is tailored to a trainee’s unique interests and training needs.

After graduating from the program, Duskin trainees are expected to contribute to their communities in Japan in disability leadership roles. They also become mentors to future program participants. Mentors give presentations in Japan about what they learned during their Duskin training. They also make themselves available via phone and Skype to talk with other young Japanese people with disabilities.

##Main Program Features
Trainees participate in an intensive leadership experience, improving their English language proficiency, acquiring knowledge and skills in disability studies, and developing their advocacy skills. They will also intern with a disability-focused government or community organization.

Specifically, trainees participate in:

1)	**A four-week intensive orientation to the program and life in Boston.** Trainees meet key program staff, receive a detailed overview of the program, tour the ICI office and the UMass Boston campus, and learn about the services and resources available to them.

Trainees learn how to get around Boston using public transportation, and how to manage other aspects of daily life. They also participate in cultural, educational, and recreational activities, learning about and experiencing American culture and history, as well as disability culture.  

2)	**Intensive English language training**, where trainees build their English language skills, preparing them to participate in English-language disability studies and leadership activities. Deaf trainees will have the option to participate in American Sign Language training.

3)	**Disability studies courses**, in which trainees gain an overview of disability as a culture. These courses address the evolution of disability advocacy, policies, and practices over time and from an international perspective. Trainees also learn about innovations in services and supports for people with disabilities.

4)	**Individualized disability leadership training (internship)**, where trainees are matched with a local training site based on their individual interests, project topics, and training needs. Examples of training sites are government agencies, non-governmental organizations, schools, research institutes, and businesses. Trainees are assigned an onsite mentor with whom they regularly meet to discuss progress with achieving their training goals.

5)	**Weekly group supervision seminar**, in which trainees discuss their placements with local government agencies or community organizations, explore their experiences, and link the experiences and training with the concepts of disability and inclusion.

##Program Wrap-Up and Concluding Activities

**Trainees give a 15-minute presentation** on their training experience in English (or American Sign Language) at a special award ceremony in Boston. Audience members include ICI / UMass Boston staff, peers, internship mentors and staff, and local, national, and international disability leaders. Trainees give a similar presentation in Japanese (or Japanese Sign Language) at an event organized by the Duskin Ainowa Foundation and held at the Duskin headquarters in Osaka, Japan.

**Trainees submit a final report** (500 – 1,000 words) about their Duskin training experience in English. The report addresses the question, issue, or problem that was the focus of their individual training (internship), what they experienced and learned, and how they will use what they learned to positively impact their community in Japan.  

**Trainees receive a certificate of completion at a special award ceremony.** They also receive guidance on how to continue their efforts in disability leadership in Japan, and how to serve as mentors to future trainees.
