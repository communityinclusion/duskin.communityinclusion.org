###Selection Process

**Applicant screening**. A panel of disability experts (Program Executive Committee) and ICI program staff will review all applications and select those individuals whose applications meet the program objectives. Successful applicants will be invited to participate in an interview at the Duskin Ainowa Foundation in Osaka.

**Candidate interviews.**

The interview has four parts:

1)	A 15-minute individual interview in Japanese with members of the Program Executive Committee (and ICI program staff) addressing the applicant’s motivation to apply for this program, potential to become a disability leader, and proposed training topic.

2)	 A 10- to 15-minute written test in which applicants are asked to respond in English. This is to test applicants’ English writing skills.

3)	A 15-minute interview in English with Duskin Ainowa Foundation staff and ICI program staff to test applicants’ basic conversational skills. Deaf applicants will be tested on their basic English language reading and writing skills, but not on their conversational skills.

4)	A health check by a medical professional.

Candidate travel expenses for attending this interview will be covered by the Duskin Ainowa Foundation.

**Candidate selection.**

The Program Executive Committee and ICI program staff will make final decisions after interviewing all potential candidates. Duskin Ainowa Foundation staff will notify all interviewees of the results. Successful candidates will be assigned a mentor -- a member of the Program Executive Committee who will assist the trainee with refining his or her training plan in conjunction with ICI program staff.
