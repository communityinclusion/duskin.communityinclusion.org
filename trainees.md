##Mai Kawabata
Mai Kawabata is a student in the master’s of educational sciences program at Tsukuba University, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences. As a young woman with a physical disability and speech impairment, Mai has worked to raise public awareness about disability in Japan. She has spoken about her experiences at the 2010 Assistive Technology and Augmentative Communication conference in Kyoto and other public forums.  

In 2008, Mai enrolled in a program sponsored by Tokyo University that hosts high school students on a college
campus to learn about academic study and student life. She presented on her experience taking the university entrance exams at a public forum hosted by Tokyo University in 2010.  

Mai would like to pursue a career in educational research. Her goal is making schools inclusive for all students and, in her words, “creating an education system that allows all children with and without disabilities to fully realize their potential and become contributing members of society.”  

As a Duskin trainee, Mai hopes to learn about how youth with disabilities are included in regular high schools, how they study, and in what ways they socialize with non-disabled youth. She is interested in the role that teachers and other school professionals play in facilitating interactions between youth with and without disabilities. Mai would also like to learn about the types of services and supports available to youth with disabilities and their families, including peer support and mentoring. For her internship, she will be working with ICI’s Education & Transition Team and with the Federation for Children with Special Needs.  

After completing the Duskin program, Mai plans to share what she has learned in Boston with this year’s participants of the Tokyo University college experience program and with the Office of Student Disability Services at her university. The experience she gains as a Duskin trainee will also inform her studies in her  master’s program.  

##Saki Kuramoto

Saki Kuramoto attended Bellevue College in Washington State majoring in psychology. She then returned to Japan, where she is working as a part-time research assistant at Tokyo University’s
Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology. At the center, Saki leads a team of research assistants that develops digital textbooks for students with disabilities. This work is funded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.

Additionally, Saki is working on the DO-IT project at the center. Modeled after a project at Washington State University in the United States (www.washington.edu/doit/), the Japan DO-IT project supports individuals with disabilities in accessing higher education and trains them in disability leadership and advocacy.

￼Saki has a physical disability and a hearing impairment. She has advocated for the disability community through lectures on topics including college admission and reasonable academic accommodations. As part of the DO-IT project, Saki helped organize an international conference in Tokyo in October 2013. The conference focused on disability and higher education, and included speakers from the Association on Higher Education and Disability in the United States and Ireland.  

Through the Duskin Disability Leadership Program, Saki hopes to learn how children with disabilities are included in regular elementary schools, how they access services, and what they think about the quality of those supports. She will also investigate what role families play in improving government-sponsored education services and supports, and how all of this compares with the situation in Japan. For her internship, Saki will be working with ICI’s Early Education Services Team and with the Federation for Children with Special Needs. She will also share her experiences via regular updates to the DO-IT mailing list.  

After completing the program, Saki would like to visit Japanese elementary schools and meet with children with disabilities and their parents, as well as teachers and other professionals. She looks forward to sharing what she has learned about inclusion of children with disabilities in the United States. And she will incorporate her knowledge and experiences into her work for DO-IT and other projects at Tokyo University.  

##Kanae Kido  

Kanae Kido is in the second year of her bachelor studies in social welfare and continuing education at Osaka Prefecture University, and is planning to continue her studies at a graduate level. Diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of eleven, she is a passionate advocate for disability issues.  

Kanae recently led a project to petition her local government to improve accessibility of a local subway station for people with mobility issues. She convened a group of 10 university students and faculty to collect evidence to support their request. This included surveying people using the subway system (such as elderly people, pregnant women, people with small children, and people using wheelchairs). The petition failed, but Kanae continues her efforts and is determined to make this subway station accessible.  

Kanae is participating in the Duskin Disability Leadership Program in order to become a stronger disability advocate. She hopes to learn about barrier-free accessible environments and public transportation systems in the United States, and how universal design principles can help develop them.  

Kanae is also interested in the public transportation experience of individuals with mobility issues, and plans to use public transit herself during her five-month stay in Boston. She is eager to learn about effective ways to advocate for disability issues, particularly those related to public transportation.  

For her internship, Kanae will work with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Department of System- Wide Accessibility, the Institute for Human Centered Design/New England ADA Center, and Project TEAM, a Boston University-based project that helps youth with disabilities identify and remove environmental barriers.  

Kanae’s goal after completing the Duskin program is to use what she has learned and experienced to inform her advocacy efforts to improve the local subway station in her community.
